## 🛤️ Development Process
1. Data Analysis and Cleaning 🧹
- Data Loading: Import the credit card transactions dataset 📥
- Basic Analysis: Explore the structure and basic statistics of the dataset 📊
- Duplicate Check: Identify and remove duplicate rows 🗑️
- Data Cleaning: Check for and handle missing values 🚫
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
- Target Variable Distribution: Visualize the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions 📊
- Correlation Matrix: Analyze the correlation between variables 🔗
- Feature Distribution: Visualize the distribution of each feature 📈
3. Data Preprocessing 🧪
- Feature and Target Separation: Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y) ✂️
- Dataset Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets 🧩
- Feature Scaling: Normalize the features to improve model performance 📏
4. Machine Learning Modeling 🤖
- Logistic Regression: Train and evaluate a logistic regression model 📉
- Random Forest: Train and evaluate a Random Forest model 🌳
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): Train and evaluate an SVM model 🧠
5. Model Evaluation and Comparison 📈
